This small Java application runs as a Windows service.
It is used to transform data from an xml file into a Wiki Markup language supporting only bold, italic, and headings.
Xml files are dropped into a user specified directory, directory path watcher detects changes,
and a 'file processor' processes the information using recursion.

To build a windows service from a java application Apache commons procrun is used. 
Procrun is a set of applications which allow Windows users to wrap (mostly) Java applications as a Windows service.
The library (commons-daemon-1.0.15-bin-windows.zip) can be downloaded from : http://www.apache.org/dist/commons/daemon/binaries/windows/ .
To run the application:
1.Export Java application as a runnable jar file
2.Update 'installService.bat' file to suite your environment (note: relative path to prunsrv.exe has to be used)
3.Run 'installService.bat' as an Administrator to install the service
4.Start the service
5.Add 'report.xml' file from 'resources' directory to the specified 'input' directory
6.The file gets processed and the output is saved into the specified 'output' directory
